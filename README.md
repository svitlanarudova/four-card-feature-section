# Frontend Mentor - Four card feature section
![Design preview for the Four card feature section](./preview.jpg)

## Project Overview 📋 

This is a solution to the [Four card feature section challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/four-card-feature-section-weK1eFYK).

## Built With 🛠️

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties (variables)
- Flexbox and Grid
- **`clamp()` function** for responsive typography and spacing
- **Component-based approach** to organizing styles
- Logical CSS properties (`inline-size`, `block-size`, `margin-block`)
- Mobile-first workflow

##  What I Learned💡



## Challenges I Faced 🚧

I’m still learning how to build a clear and scalable variable system — using meaningful names and keeping the code clean and easy to maintain.

##  Acknowledgments 🙏
Thanks to Frontend Mentor for providing this challenge and to the community for their helpful feedback and resources on modern CSS techniques.
